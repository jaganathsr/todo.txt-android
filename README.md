This is a fork of Gina Trapani's excellent Todo.txt project. My goal is to get it working with box.com as I do not use Dropbox and have a 50GB free account with Box.com!

# Todo.txt for Android

The official Todo.txt Android application by [Gina Trapani](http://ginatrapani.org) and [the Todo.txt community](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/todotxt/) designed to manage your [todo.txt file](http://todotxt.com) stored in [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com).

[Purchase Todo.txt on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.todotxt.todotxttouch), the [Amazon Appstore](http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/B004MNQTVU/ref=nosim/lifehackerboo-20), or download and compile the source code. This app is in active development and there are several [known bugs and todo items](https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-android/issues). 

Using Todo.txt for Android requires a [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) account in order to sync your file across devices.

There are multitudes of todo list managers for Android. Todo.txt is a minimalist, plain-text focused solution we built to learn by collaborating on Android development. 

Interested in joining in? Fork the project and talk to us on the [Todo.txt mailing list](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/todotxt/).
